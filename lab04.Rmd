This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#item 2
ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat,price))+geom_point()+xlab("carat")+ylab("price")

#item 3
ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat,price))+geom_point()+xlab("carat")+ylab("price")+facet_grid(clarity ~.)

#item 5
ggplot(diamonds,aes(price))+geom_histogram(color=10)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
